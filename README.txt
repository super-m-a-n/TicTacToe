A basic tic-tac-toe game I made because i was bored *shrug*
Default is computer's turn (computer plays first). To tell computer to make a move, just press the CPU PLAY button.
To make a move yourself, just press the desired box in the grid.
To change who plays first just go to options menu tab,  reset game and choose who starts computer/player
After a finished game, to restart, go to options tab, reset game and choose who starts computer/player
